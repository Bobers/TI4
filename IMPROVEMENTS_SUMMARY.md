# Twilight Imperium RuleMaster AI - Improvements Summary

## Overview
The app has been significantly enhanced to include the complete TI4 rules database that was missing from the original implementation.

## Major Improvements

### 1. Complete Rules Integration
- Created a conversion script (`scripts/convertPhpRules.js`) that processes all PHP rule files from `tirules-main`
- Converted 101 rule sections, 9 component categories, and 25 faction descriptions
- Generated `data/completeRulebook.ts` with fully structured rule data
- Integrated complete rules into the RAG system for accurate AI responses

### 2. Fixed Environment Configuration
- Updated to use Vite-compatible environment variables (`VITE_API_KEY`)
- Created proper `.env.example` file with instructions
- Fixed import issues for ES modules

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
- Updated README with comprehensive setup instructions
- Added feature list highlighting the complete rules coverage
- Included proper attribution to source repository

## Technical Details

### Rules Coverage
- **Base Rules**: All 101 rule sections from the core game
- **Components**: Action cards, agendas, objectives, technologies, units, etc.
- **Factions**: All 25 factions including Prophecy of Kings expansion
- **Format**: Clean markdown-style text with preserved structure

### Data Processing
The conversion script:
- Strips HTML tags while preserving content structure
- Converts lists to proper markdown format
- Handles special formatting (small caps, entities, etc.)
- Generates TypeScript-compatible exports

## Usage

To use the improved app:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Gemini API key: `VITE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
4. The AI will now have access to complete TI4 rules for accurate responses

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:
- Add search functionality for specific rules
- Implement rule bookmarks/favorites
- Add visual rule diagrams
- Create rule quick reference cards
- Add multiplayer rule clarification mode
