      "rulesReference": "Cards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.\n\n• If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.\n    \n• If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.\n    \n• Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.\n\n• If an ability with a specified duration is resolved, the effect of the ability remains through that duration, even if the component that caused the ability is removed.\n\n• If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own paragraph.\n    \n• If an ability contains the word \"Action\" a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability.\n    \n• If an ability uses the word \"cannot\", that effect is absolute.\n\n• If two abilities use the word \"cannot\", a persistent ability takes precedence over a one-time ability and an enabling ability takes precedence over a cancel ability.\n\n• When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word \"may\" are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.\n    \n• Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those abilities use the word \"may\".\n    \n• If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word \"and\", a player must resolve as many of the ability's effects as possible. However, if the player cannot resolve all of its effects, that player is allowed to resolve as many as they can.\n    \n#\n\n\n• Costs\n\n• Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The cost of an ability is separated from the effect by the word \"to\" or by a semicolon. A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if they cannot resolve that ability's cost.\n    \n• Some examples of an ability's cost include spending resources, spending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, purging cards, and activating specific systems.\n    \n#\n\n\n• Timing\n\n• If the timing of an ability uses the word \"before\" or \"after\", the ability's effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.\n\n• For example, if an ability is resolved \"after a ship is destroyed\", the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not later during that turn or round.\n\n• If the timing of an ability uses the word \"when\", the ability's effect occurs at the moment of the described timing event.\n\n• Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way.\n\n• Effects that occur \"when\" an event happens take priority over effects that occur \"after\" an event happens.\n    \n• If an ability uses the word \"then\", a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word \"then\" or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs after the word \"then\".\n    \n• Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability's timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved \"at the start of combat\", it can be resolved at the start of each combat.\n    \n• If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the action phase, each player takes a turn resolving an ability in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.\n    \n• If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the strategy or agenda phases, players take turns resolving abilities starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.\n    \n#\n\n\n• Component-specific Rules\n\n• The opening paragraph of each ability found on an action card describes when a player can resolve that card's ability.\n    \n• The opening paragraph of most abilities found on promissory notes describes when a player can resolve that card's ability.\n\n• Some promissory notes have abilities that trigger as soon as a player receives the card.\n\n• Abilities on agenda cards correspond to an outcome. Players resolve these abilities during the agenda phase after players vote for a particular outcome.\n    \n• Each faction has faction abilities presented on its faction sheet. Each faction's flagship has one or more unique abilities. Some abilities provide players with perpetual effects.\n    \n• Some units have unit abilities. These abilities are named and presented above a unit's attributes on a player's faction sheet or on a unit upgrade card. Each unit ability has unique rules for when a player can resolve that ability. The following abilities are unit abilities:\n\n• Anti-Fighter Barrage\n        \n• Bombardment\n        \n• Deploy\n        \n• Planetary Shield\n        \n• Production\n        \n• Space Cannon\n        \n• Sustain Damage\n\n• If a unit's ability uses the phrase \"this system\" or \"this planet\", the ability is referring to the system or planet that contains that unit.",
      "notes": "• An ability may be triggered during the timing window it was gained, if applicable. For example, if a player receives the Creuss player's Creuss Iff promissory note at the start of their turn, they may use it immediately.\n\n• Note that some triggers check their conditions when they trigger, while some check their conditions when they would resolve.\n        \n• The Ul player's Awaken ability is an example of an ability that checks its condition when it triggers; activating a system without a sleeper token will not trigger Awaken, even if a sleeper token is later added during the activation step of that tactical action.\n        \n• The Assault Cannon technology is an example of an ability that checks its condition when it would resolve; a player without three or more non-fighter ships in the system cannot use Assault Cannon, even if they previously had more ships.\n\n• An ability from a single physical object cannot be resolved more than once in one timing window. For example, if a player starts their turn with the Creuss player's Creuss Iff promissory note in their hand (having received it on a previous turn) and uses it, they will not be able to use it a second time this turn, if they receive it again as part of a transaction.\n\n• Each unit on the board is its own separate physical object. For example, two or more of the N'orr player's Exotrireme II in a system may use their ability to destroy themselves and other ships, as the ability is linked to the units on the game board, and not the unit upgrade technology card.\n\n• Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played during a single timing window to affect the same units or game effect. See the action cards page for more details.\n    \n• During the action phase, abilities are resolved in the current relative turn order, starting with the active player. For example, if it is currently the Trade (5) player's turn, they will have the option to resolve first, then the Warfare (6) player, then the Technology (7) player, and so on.\n\n• If a player has multiple abilities they wish to resolve, they must be resolved one at a time. Between each ability being resolved, each other player will have the opportunity to resolve one ability.\n        \n• For example, Alice, the active player, wishes to resolve four abilities during the current timing window. Bob, the next player in order, wishes to resolve one. Cheng, later in the order, wishes to resolve two. The order of resolution would be: Alice &num;1; Bob &num;1; Cheng &num;1; Alice &num;2; Cheng &num;2; Alice &num;3; Alice &num;4.\n        \n• Once every player has consecutively declined to resolve an ability during a timing window, no more abilities may be resolved during that window.\n        \n• A player may decline to resolve an ability during a timing window, but later choose to resolve an ability during that same timing window, but only if another player chooses to resolve an ability after the player declined.\n        \n• Following on from the above example, had Alice declined to resolve \"Alice &num;2\", she could still resolve \"Alice &num;3\", as Cheng resolved \"Cheng &num;2\", breaking the series of consecutive declinations. However, if Alice had instead declined to resolve \"Alice &num;3\", she would be unable to resolve \"Alice &num;4\", as then each player would have consecutively declined to resolve an ability.\n\n• The secondary abilities of strategy cards are resolved in clockwise order, after the primary ability.\n    \n• A player may resolve \"at the start of your turn\" and \"at the end of your turn\" abilities on the turn that they pass.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"when\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"after\" the same event occurs.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"after\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"before\" the next event occurs.",

As such, these cards may be played even if they would cause no effect.\n    \n• If an action card targets a specific number of a particular type of object, that action card cannot be played if those objects do not currently exist. For example, Repeal Law cannot be played if there are no laws in play.\n    \n• If a player has more than seven action cards, they must discard the excess immediately. They cannot play them to get down to seven, and the Hacan player cannot trade them.\n    \n• For notes about specific action cards, see the action card component notes page.",

During the Bombardment step, players perform the following steps:\n\n• Step 1 - The active player chooses which planet each of their units that has a Bombardment ability will bombard. Then, that player rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit's Bombardment value.\n\n• A unit's Bombardment ability is presented along with a unit's attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.\n        \n• The Bombardment ability is displayed as \"Bombardment X (&times;Y)\". The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all Bombardment abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.\n        \n• Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.\n        \n• Multiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.\n        \n• The L1Z1X's Harrow ability does not affect the L1Z1X player's own ground forces.\n        \n• Planets that contain a unit with the Planetary Shield ability cannot be bombarded.\n\n• Step 2 - The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.\n\n• If a player has to assign more hits than that player has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.",
      "notes": "• The Bombardment step happens outside of combat. No combat effects may affect a bombardment roll.\n\n• A player cannot score a secret objective that requires them to win a combat or similar by destroying units during the Bombardment step.\n\n• Mechs may use their Sustain Damage ability to cancel a hit produced by a bombardment roll.\n    \n• Only the active player may bombard.

However, if they choose to use the Bombardment ability, they must use the Bombardment ability of each unit in the active system.\n\n• Say a player had three dreadnoughts in the active system, and owned the Plasma Scoring technology.

If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that result produces a hit.\n\n• If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.\n        \n• If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, that player rolls these dice separately.\n        \n• First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value of \"1\". Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value of \"2\", and then \"3\", continuing in numerical order until that player has rolled dice for each of their ships.\n        \n• The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce.

This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent's die.\n\n• Step 4 - Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.\n\n• Before assigning hits, players may use their units' Sustain Damage abilities to cancel hits.\n        \n• When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.\n\n• Step 5 - Retreat: If a player announced a retreat during step 2, and there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must retreat.\n\n• If a player announced a retreat during the Announce Retreats step, but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.\n        \n• To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active system. That player's fighters and ground forces in the space area of the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.\n        \n• The system that a player's units retreat to must contain one or more of that player's units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.\n        \n• If any of a player's units successfully retreat and are moved into an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.\n\n• After the Retreat step, if both players still have ships in the active system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with the Announce Retreats step.\n    \n• Space combat ends when only one player - or neither player - has a ship in the space area of the active system.\n\n• During the last round of a combat, \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n\n• After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.\n\n• If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any excess units.",

      "notes": "• The wormhole nexus will flip if a unit exists in the system while inactive, even if that unit did not move through a gamma wormhole.\n    \n• As the wormhole nexus becomes active at the end of the Movement step, only units with the Deep Space Cannon ability in systems containing a gamma wormhole will be able to produce hits during the Space Cannon Offense step during that action.\n    \n• If the Creuss player moves their Hil Colish flagship into the inactive wormhole nexus, the wormhole nexus will not flip before they move any other ships. Any other ships they wish to move into the wormhole nexus must do so via either a delta wormhole or a gamma wormhole, unless the Creuss player is utilizing the ability of their agent, Emissary Taivra.\n    \n• Any units and tokens on the inactive side are transferred to the active side when the wormhole nexus flips.\n    \n• A ship in the wormhole will single-handedly qualify for the Become the Gatekeeper objective.",

      "rulesReference": "Some systems contain wormholes. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent.\n\n• There are two basic types of wormholes: alpha and beta.\n    \n• If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the Space Cannon abilities of their PDS units through wormholes.\n    \n• Players can be neighbors and perform transactions through wormholes.\n    \n• There are two advanced types of wormhole: delta and gamma. These wormholes follow all other wormhole rules.\n\n• The delta wormholes are present on the Creuss Gate system tile and the Ghosts of Creuss home system tile.\n        \n• The gamma wormholes are present on the wormhole nexus and can be discovered during exploration.",
      "notes": "• A system with a wormhole is not an anomaly.\n    \n• If a system contains multiple wormholes of the same type, those are treated as separate wormholes.\n    \n• A system cannot be adjacent to itself, even if it has multiple wormholes in it.\n    \n• A player chooses the path of adjacent systems each ship moves through during movement. If two systems on that path are adjacent because of a wormhole, that ship moves through that wormhole.\n\n• If the two systems are adjacent because of a wormhole and because of a shared edge or another reason, the player may choose whether or not the ship moves through the wormhole.\n        \n• If the two systems are adjacent because of two types of wormholes, the player chooses which type of wormhole the ship moves through.\n        \n• A player may move a ship back and forth through a wormhole between two systems any number of times, if its movement value is high enough.\n\n• For additional information on how the Creuss interact with wormholes, see their faction notes page.",
