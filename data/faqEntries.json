Answer: Prototype War Sun I is considered a war sun but is a printed unit not a war sun technology. Thus, a vote of \"For\" would mean that it would lose the Sustain Damage ability but other players would not be able to ignore war sun prerequisites. A vote of \"Against\" would not affect the Muaat player. The agenda plays as normal if the Muaat player has researched Prototype War Sun II.",
