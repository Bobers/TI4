For example, if a player starts their turn with the Creuss player's Creuss Iff promissory note in their hand (having received it on a previous turn) and uses it, they will not be able to use it a second time this turn, if they receive it again as part of a transaction.\n\n• Each unit on the board is its own separate physical object.

Bob, the next player in order, wishes to resolve one. Cheng, later in the order, wishes to resolve two.

However, if Alice had instead declined to resolve \"Alice &num;3\", she would be unable to resolve \"Alice &num;4\", as then each player would have consecutively declined to resolve an ability.\n\n• The secondary abilities of strategy cards are resolved in clockwise order, after the primary ability.\n    \n• A player may resolve \"at the start of your turn\" and \"at the end of your turn\" abilities on the turn that they pass.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"when\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"after\" the same event occurs.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"after\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"before\" the next event occurs.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":1,"keywords":["player","resolve","ability","num","abilities","alice","during","turn","window","example"],"crossReferences":["Action Cards","Active Player","Initiative Order","Leaders","Promissory Notes","Relics","Speaker","Strategy Card","Technology"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.089,0.028,-0.027,0.019,0.008,0.02,0.115,0.038,0.072,0.035,0.004,-0.016,0.038,-0.018,0.039,0.008,0.002,-0.007,-0.096,0.024,0.124,-0.075,-0.031,-0.017,-0.1,-0.022,-0.041,-0.064,-0.056,-0.052,-0.006,0.09,-0.003,0.005,-0.055,0.049,0.054,0.03,-0.02,-0.021,0.003,-0.026,0.021,-0.002,-0.005,-0.047,-0.063,0.002,-0.128,-0.015,-0.084,-0.007,-0.033,0.078,0.07,0.019,0.005,0.028,0.007,-0.041,-0.055,-0.031,-0.016,-0.045,0.069,0.012,0.021,-0.047,-0.008,0.001,0.01,-0.01,-0.07,-0.095,0.031,0.04,0.062,0.029,-0.022,-0.096,0.004,0.059,0.015,-0.111,-0.005,-0.028,-0.02,-0.01,0.065,0.071,0.026,-0.054,-0.007,-0.002,0.12,-0.022,0.066,-0.043,0.059,0.051,0.016,-0.017,-0.023,0.008,0.031,0.006,-0.039,-0.046,-0.055,-0.051,-0.006,-0.036,0.026,-0.041,-0.025,0.071,-0.052,0.028,0.039,-0.044,0.062,-0.056,0.09,-0.052,0.023,-0.001,-0.04,0,-0.057,-0.076,-0.09,-0.001,-0.024,-0.068,-0.024,-0.022,0.01,-0.026,-0.037,0.118,0.095,0.037,0.052,-0.015,0.011,0.032,0.048,0.057,0.089,0.074,-0.031,-0.035,0.014,0.048,-0.022,0.042,-0.091,0.021,0.016,0.018,-0.002,0.032,0.03,0.026,-0.012,-0.043,-0.016,-0.1,-0.052,0.001,-0.092,-0.025,-0.021,-0.132,-0.031,0.009,0.023,0.039,0.036,0.051,0.027,-0.11,0.061,0.044,0.004,0.046,-0.008,0.12,-0.005,-0.061,0.032,-0.05,0.019,0.067,-0.024,-0.07,0.069,-0.06,-0.042,0.041,0.086,-0.041,0.01,0.008,0.039,0.015,-0.101,-0.006,-0.1,-0.039,-0.037,0.071,-0.059,-0.035,-0.023,-0.038,-0.154,-0.071,0.027,0.011,0.046,0.061,0.015,0,0.024,-0.059,-0.077,0.011,0.041,0.016,0.001,-0.028,-0.06,-0.055,-0.023,-0.011,-0.066,-0.019,-0.001,-0.025,0.039,0.015,0.023,0.094,0.107,0.056,-0.039,-0.046,0.049,0.039,-0.024,0.03,0.004,-0.011,0.041,-0.061,-0.053,0.045,0.044,-0.006,0.044,-0.026,-0.05,-0.052,0.102,0.044,0.007,0.035,-0.024,0.041,0.042,0.038,-0.018,-0.023,0.069,-0.077,0.02,0.005,-0.045,0.045,0.136,-0.076,0.007,0.017,0.077,-0.036,0.064,0.036,0.057,0.014,-0.055,-0.038,-0.016,-0.003,0.067,-0.011,-0.027,-0.022,0.022,0.006,-0.042,-0.11,-0.078,-0.071,-0.14,-0.038,-0.019,0.029,-0.086,0.04,0.011,0.004,0.082,-0.035,-0.009,0.025,-0.015,0.056,-0.068,0,-0.011,0.011,0,0.029,0.031,-0.011,0.043,-0.072,-0.058,0.031,0.068,0.042,0.077,-0.111,0.099,0.017,-0.02,-0.068,-0.102,-0.034,0.034,-0.065,0.007,-0.009,-0.047,0.021,0.032,0.045,0.036,0.016,0.002,-0.007,0.025,0.061,0.007,0.048,0.057,-0.023,-0.007,0.08,0,-0.035,-0.035,0.05,0.029,0.045,-0.098,-0.104,-0.022,0.047,-0.029,0.011,-0.071,0.023,-0.027,0.074,0.092,-0.002,0.094,0.015,0.073,0.072,0.058,-0.001]},{"id":"rule_abilities_full","type":"rule","category":"abilities","title":"Abilities - Complete","section":"full","content":"Cards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.\n\n• If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.\n    \n• If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence.

However, if Alice had instead declined to resolve \"Alice &num;3\", she would be unable to resolve \"Alice &num;4\", as then each player would have consecutively declined to resolve an ability.\n\n• The secondary abilities of strategy cards are resolved in clockwise order, after the primary ability.\n    \n• A player may resolve \"at the start of your turn\" and \"at the end of your turn\" abilities on the turn that they pass.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"when\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"after\" the same event occurs.\n    \n• All abilities that occur \"after\" an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur \"before\" the next event occurs.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":1,"keywords":["ability","player","resolve","abilities","num","alice","during","turn","resolved","window"],"crossReferences":["Action Cards","Active Player","Initiative Order","Leaders","Promissory Notes","Relics","Speaker","Strategy Card","Technology"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.068,0.025,0.014,0.032,0.034,0.021,0.053,0.005,0.065,0.024,-0.002,0.006,0.048,0.005,-0.002,0.009,0.016,0.025,-0.126,0.017,0.154,-0.053,-0.048,-0.003,-0.097,0.01,-0.054,-0.054,-0.014,-0.028,-0.014,0.111,0,0.001,-0.059,0.051,0.007,0.023,-0.023,-0.05,0.006,0.004,-0.016,-0.021,0.02,-0.045,-0.047,-0.014,-0.143,-0.005,-0.086,-0.01,-0.034,0.06,0.042,0.023,-0.019,0.02,-0.006,-0.056,-0.051,-0.032,-0.045,-0.025,0.084,0.019,0.032,-0.059,-0.014,0.045,0.017,0.008,-0.052,-0.053,0.042,0.029,0.032,0.031,0.014,-0.058,-0.001,0.075,0.01,-0.101,-0.03,-0.083,-0.004,-0.003,0.062,0.074,0.025,-0.085,0.047,-0.024,0.14,-0.038,0.072,-0.058,0.017,-0.007,-0.007,-0.018,-0.039,0.001,-0.006,-0.039,-0.031,-0.034,-0.053,-0.034,-0.005,-0.059,0.034,-0.037,-0.009,0.085,0.007,0.007,0.033,-0.045,0.034,-0.024,0.121,-0.039,0.025,0.003,-0.031,0,-0.042,-0.062,-0.108,0.016,0.017,-0.041,-0.012,-0.008,0.011,-0.005,-0.023,0.103,0.036,0.025,0.062,0.054,0.063,0.026,0.028,0.045,0.115,0.061,-0.021,-0.015,-0.037,0,-0.018,0.039,-0.103,0.005,0.021,-0.012,0.013,0.034,0.028,0.032,-0.021,-0.039,0.006,-0.075,-0.079,0.001,-0.087,-0.017,0.007,-0.147,0.005,0.05,-0.001,0.057,0.07,0.079,0.086,-0.16,0.047,0.043,-0.052,0.04,-0.031,0.087,0.02,-0.079,-0.003,-0.022,0.026,0.11,-0.021,-0.051,0.025,-0.088,-0.036,-0.002,0.049,-0.022,0.008,-0.016,0.016,-0.024,-0.071,0.009,-0.05,-0.02,-0.005,0.093,-0.052,-0.038,0.028,-0.018,-0.102,-0.087,0.045,0.005,0.065,0.043,0.051,0,0.023,-0.099,-0.073,0.021,0.017,0.043,-0.029,-0.018,-0.002,-0.116,-0.036,0.006,-0.075,-0.04,-0.08,0.04,-0.053,0.014,0.011,0.124,0.043,0.014,-0.017,-0.043,0.034,0.071,-0.024,0.032,-0.012,0.049,0.067,-0.06,-0.101,-0.023,0.041,-0.022,0.011,-0.008,-0.061,-0.032,0.083,0.055,0.011,0.015,-0.001,-0.013,0.071,0.01,-0.002,-0.006,0.08,-0.074,0.04,0.023,-0.008,0.05,0.114,-0.045,0.068,-0.033,0.065,-0.024,0.024,0.041,0.089,0.028,-0.048,-0.015,0.028,-0.042,0.039,-0.011,-0.057,-0.051,0.046,0.043,-0.021,-0.061,-0.087,-0.055,-0.119,-0.035,-0.031,-0.023,-0.081,0.023,-0.011,-0.007,0.116,0.01,0.022,0.042,-0.035,0.016,-0.088,0,-0.009,-0.002,-0.052,0.003,0.034,-0.014,0.063,-0.089,-0.031,0.035,0.147,0.044,0.052,-0.102,0.055,0.006,-0.004,-0.043,-0.104,-0.011,0.007,-0.064,-0.022,-0.009,-0.004,-0.005,0.052,0.027,0.029,0.047,0.006,-0.019,0.021,0.054,0.008,0.018,0.064,-0.036,-0.019,0.042,0.027,0.014,-0.04,0.056,0.043,-0.019,-0.039,-0.077,-0.025,0.066,-0.042,0.03,-0.064,0.043,0.017,0.02,0.096,0.038,0.079,-0.031,0.11,0.069,0.035,-0.053]},{"id":"rule_action_cards_main","type":"rule","category":"cards","title":"Action Cards","section":"rules_reference","content":"Action cards provide players with various abilities that they can resolve as described on the cards.\n\n• Each player draws one action card during each status phase.\n    \n• Players can draw action cards by resolving the primary and secondary abilities of the Politics strategy card.\n    \n• When a player draws an action card, they take the top card from the action card deck and add it to their hand of action cards.\n    \n• Each player's hand can have a maximum of seven action cards.

Place that card on the top of the agenda card discard pile.\n    \n• If an \"Against\" outcome of a law received the most votes, players resolve the outcome and discard the agenda.\n    \n• Directives provide one-time game effects.\n    \n• When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card.\n\n• When resolving the primary ability of the Politics card, the active player cannot show the agenda cards they drew to any other player.\n    \n• If the outcome of an agenda affects multiple players, it will do so in speaker order.\n    \n• For notes about specific agenda cards, see the agenda card component notes page.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":7,"keywords":["agenda","card","law","outcome","cards","players","play","player","votes","area"],"crossReferences":["Agenda Phase","Attach","Politics","Speaker","Victory Points"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.01,0.055,-0.03,-0.03,0.046,0.06,-0.016,-0.051,0.065,0.023,-0.056,0,-0.011,0.033,0.024,-0.003,0.012,-0.005,-0.061,0.049,0.1,0.021,-0.032,-0.027,-0.055,-0.015,-0.041,0.001,-0.019,-0.071,0.081,0.059,0.056,0.098,-0.047,-0.076,-0.034,-0.071,-0.018,-0.041,0.036,0.026,-0.031,-0.023,-0.051,-0.001,-0.054,0.072,-0.084,0.009,-0.1,-0.016,-0.044,0.097,0.092,0.014,-0.005,0.029,-0.042,-0.015,-0.032,0.004,-0.076,0.043,-0.039,0.046,0.011,0.009,-0.053,0.02,0.035,-0.008,0.017,-0.084,0.034,0.009,-0.002,0.029,0.05,-0.145,-0.032,0.054,-0.012,-0.068,0.062,-0.111,-0.054,-0.009,0.062,0.042,-0.074,0.033,0.145,0.021,0.072,0.01,0.045,-0.061,0.066,0.088,-0.066,-0.03,-0.027,-0.01,0.006,-0.011,-0.047,0.035,-0.095,0.001,0.004,0.011,0.018,-0.027,-0.021,0.025,0.049,0.097,0.015,0.011,0.016,-0.052,0.051,-0.008,0.035,-0.022,0.006,0,-0.021,-0.146,-0.111,-0.003,0.029,0.047,-0.024,-0.017,-0.038,0.053,0.074,0.089,0.074,0.053,0.056,-0.036,-0.025,0.101,0.007,0.037,0.042,0.068,0.018,-0.041,0.044,0.081,0.027,-0.057,-0.058,0.026,-0.006,-0.025,0.045,-0.034,0.023,0.109,-0.023,-0.035,0.007,-0.07,-0.03,-0.009,-0.029,-0.027,-0.088,-0.052,-0.003,0.018,0.026,0.041,0.09,-0.031,0.076,-0.096,-0.007,-0.045,-0.101,0.055,-0.023,-0.028,0.056,-0.047,-0.014,0.025,-0.003,0.053,-0.087,-0.069,0.084,-0.068,0.007,0.031,0.073,0.045,-0.07,0.02,-0.029,-0.007,-0.054,-0.018,-0.103,-0.006,-0.005,-0.033,0.025,-0.004,0.057,-0.044,-0.042,-0.068,-0.014,-0.008,0.081,0.022,0.052,0,-0.07,-0.065,-0.072,-0.029,-0.007,0.001,-0.023,-0.051,0.002,-0.09,-0.095,0.013,0.031,-0.002,0.039,-0.066,-0.001,0.005,-0.022,0.07,0.016,0.057,-0.027,0.057,-0.012,0.011,0.017,-0.04,0.058,-0.02,0.016,-0.089,-0.154,-0.071,-0.002,0.026,-0.022,-0.064,-0.072,0.007,0.023,-0.022,-0.012,0.065,-0.052,0.005,0.047,0.094,-0.03,-0.031,-0.015,-0.024,0.008,0.006,-0.037,0.046,0.073,-0.043,0.048,0.006,0.056,0.002,-0.029,0.017,0.07,0.024,-0.071,-0.059,0.11,0.03,-0.021,0.018,-0.128,-0.008,0.057,0.112,0.015,-0.005,-0.023,-0.027,-0.041,0.019,-0.034,-0.04,0.06,-0.016,-0.001,-0.022,0.037,0.088,-0.028,0.012,0.039,-0.001,-0.04,0,-0.046,0.026,-0.037,0.04,-0.012,-0.022,0.026,-0.116,-0.044,-0.07,0.116,0.069,-0.008,-0.079,0.046,-0.008,0.003,-0.052,-0.109,0.027,-0.02,-0.05,-0.006,-0.002,-0.02,0.031,-0.015,0.04,0.033,0.073,0.012,0.011,-0.011,0.032,0.07,0.02,-0.033,0.014,0.077,0.06,0.056,-0.033,-0.019,0.053,-0.03,0.025,-0.089,-0.032,0.04,-0.003,-0.094,-0.033,-0.099,-0.003,0.03,0.02,0.078,0.061,0.098,-0.013,0.085,0.107,-0.023,0]},{"id":"rule_agenda_phase_main","type":"rule","category":"game_round","title":"Agenda Phase","section":"rules_reference","content":"During the agenda phase, players can cast votes on agendas that can change the rules of the game.\n\n• Players skip the agenda phase during the early portion of each game.

Casting zero votes is the same as abstaining.\n    \n• When a player casts votes during the agenda phase, it is not that player's turn for the purpose of game effects.\n    \n• If an agenda outcome affects multiple players, it does so in speaker order.\n    \n• Riders are resolved after the agenda is fully resolved, in speaker order.\n    \n• If a player successfully predicts multiple riders, they resolve one at a time, in the order that player chooses, with each other player having the opportunity to resolve an ability between each.\n    \n• Each pair of players may resolve one transaction during each agenda.\n    \n• Only planets ready at the end of the phase. Technologies, leaders, relics, and other cards do not.\n    \n• For notes about specific agenda cards, see the agenda card component notes page.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":8,"keywords":["agenda","each","phase","players","player","resolve","votes","game","outcome","during"],"crossReferences":["Agenda Cards","Custodians Token","Game Round","Influence","Speaker","Transactions"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[0.004,0.059,-0.004,-0.023,0,0,-0.034,-0.017,0.086,0.061,-0.088,-0.048,0.021,-0.019,0.002,-0.004,-0.038,-0.012,-0.03,0.007,0.09,-0.041,-0.017,-0.013,-0.06,0.01,-0.046,0.001,0.018,-0.067,0.057,0.069,0.049,0.041,-0.016,-0.005,-0.009,-0.05,-0.05,-0.05,0.034,-0.031,-0.025,0.011,0,0.013,-0.079,0.048,-0.097,-0.028,-0.097,-0.044,-0.018,0.1,0.071,0.045,-0.022,0.004,-0.029,-0.032,-0.024,-0.042,-0.094,0.024,-0.017,0.084,0.003,-0.009,-0.001,0.036,0.041,-0.043,-0.011,-0.118,0.046,0.047,0.057,0.003,0.008,-0.091,-0.045,0.019,0.015,-0.09,0.06,-0.11,-0.039,-0.017,0.06,0.063,-0.109,0.027,0.088,-0.025,0.097,0.048,0.053,-0.05,0.067,0.091,-0.012,0.035,-0.035,-0.051,-0.031,-0.006,-0.066,0.031,-0.092,-0.001,-0.051,0.018,0.054,-0.027,-0.017,0.02,-0.007,0.074,0.074,0.024,0.054,-0.038,0.061,-0.004,0.034,-0.015,0.01,0,-0.037,-0.072,-0.037,-0.008,0.012,0.034,-0.017,-0.04,-0.062,-0.008,0.069,0.065,0.033,0.026,0.083,-0.107,-0.009,0.106,-0.001,0.028,0.021,0.042,0.006,-0.048,0.033,0.096,-0.018,-0.04,-0.092,0.045,-0.019,-0.027,-0.018,0.028,0.001,0.033,-0.011,-0.065,-0.006,-0.064,-0.063,0.005,0.006,-0.051,-0.11,-0.075,0.035,0.037,0.046,0.059,0.086,0.02,0.041,-0.113,0.012,-0.024,-0.007,-0.016,-0.059,0.018,0.058,-0.043,-0.039,-0.025,0.026,0.095,-0.112,-0.057,0.103,-0.031,-0.014,0.025,0.095,0.016,-0.01,0.038,0.027,-0.012,-0.054,-0.002,-0.044,-0.001,-0.026,-0.06,-0.014,0,0.076,0.005,-0.073,-0.079,-0.019,-0.039,0.08,0.096,-0.027,0,-0.065,-0.047,-0.058,-0.004,0.03,-0.003,0.008,-0.085,0.049,-0.072,-0.06,0.031,0.013,-0.04,0.04,-0.066,0.097,-0.002,0.017,0.043,0.06,0.067,-0.115,0.054,-0.001,0.014,0.071,-0.019,0.089,0.014,0.023,-0.096,-0.098,-0.031,0.012,0.06,-0.038,-0.031,-0.059,-0.001,0.069,-0.044,-0.059,0.064,-0.031,0.036,0.034,0.155,-0.05,-0.016,-0.027,-0.007,0.002,0.006,-0.001,0.043,0.033,-0.078,0.066,-0.026,0.012,-0.005,0.028,0.001,0.073,-0.001,-0.065,-0.041,0.033,0.031,-0.006,0.038,-0.064,-0.019,0.083,0.069,-0.048,-0.022,-0.008,-0.04,-0.134,0.03,-0.011,-0.03,0.02,-0.044,0.007,0.023,0.017,0.05,0.001,0.041,0.05,0.049,-0.015,0,0.003,-0.03,-0.005,0.036,0.064,-0.023,0.027,-0.073,-0.051,0.006,0.146,0.046,0.04,-0.089,0.028,0.041,0.017,-0.023,-0.111,-0.022,-0.035,-0.045,-0.06,-0.085,0.005,0.024,0,0.084,-0.012,0.025,-0.035,0.005,0.001,0.032,0.013,0.06,-0.013,0.037,0.054,0.063,0.043,-0.005,-0.003,0.07,-0.07,0.068,-0.151,0.023,-0.023,-0.055,-0.088,-0.029,-0.07,0.011,0.04,0.044,0.037,-0.022,0.104,-0.001,0.049,0.079,-0.048,-0.012]},{"id":"rule_anomalies_main","type":"rule","category":"anomalies","title":"Anomalies","section":"rules_reference","content":"An anomaly is a system tile that has unique rules.\n\n• An anomaly is identified by a red border located on the tile's corners.\n    \n• There are four types of anomalies: asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, and gravity rifts.\n\n• Some anomalies contain planets; those systems are still anomalies.\n\n• Each type of anomaly is identified by its art.

They would be able to roll their choice of zero, three, or four dice when resolving their Bombardment ability.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":15,"keywords":["bombardment","ability","unit","player","roll","planet","units","each","dice","not"],"crossReferences":["Abilities","Destroyed","Ground Forces","Invasion","Planetary Shield"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.003,0.045,0.009,-0.005,0.037,-0.067,0.1,0.029,0.01,0.063,0.024,-0.055,0.11,-0.022,-0.036,-0.008,0.025,-0.007,-0.101,0.025,0.073,0.044,0,0.042,0.014,-0.067,-0.065,0.088,0,-0.055,0.045,0.099,0.011,0.004,-0.061,0.032,0.034,0.012,-0.079,-0.001,-0.048,0.054,0.026,0.013,0.003,-0.015,-0.064,0.007,-0.028,-0.021,0.035,0.013,-0.034,0.114,0.021,-0.085,-0.007,0.036,-0.025,-0.057,-0.096,0.001,-0.018,-0.012,0.109,-0.041,0.057,0.021,-0.076,0.049,0.003,-0.054,-0.024,-0.087,0.028,0.099,-0.001,0.027,-0.047,-0.042,0.001,0.04,-0.039,-0.07,-0.059,-0.016,-0.02,0.026,0.15,0.048,0.038,0.033,0.018,0.037,0.037,-0.027,0.057,-0.094,0,0.052,-0.041,-0.034,-0.073,-0.029,-0.026,-0.027,-0.022,-0.006,-0.113,-0.044,0.007,-0.012,-0.053,-0.071,-0.036,-0.041,0.101,0.01,0.003,-0.135,0.025,-0.076,-0.003,0.021,0.05,0.007,-0.075,0,0.011,-0.022,-0.031,0.009,-0.057,-0.079,-0.017,0.073,0.048,0.027,-0.068,0.045,0.091,0.022,0.077,-0.019,0.063,0.011,-0.008,0.063,0.008,0.076,-0.06,-0.056,0.027,0.025,-0.024,-0.035,-0.135,0.003,-0.031,0.031,-0.007,0.063,-0.006,0.053,-0.075,-0.044,0.005,-0.12,-0.059,-0.033,-0.046,-0.018,-0.002,-0.061,-0.004,-0.026,0.032,-0.022,0.09,0.033,0.039,-0.032,0.039,0.039,0.036,0.007,-0.012,0.136,-0.011,-0.068,-0.018,0.023,0.088,0.063,-0.055,-0.014,0.064,-0.035,-0.081,0.014,0.114,0.03,0.04,-0.014,0.059,0.003,0.064,0.001,-0.061,0.006,-0.066,-0.069,-0.077,-0.002,0.046,-0.018,-0.095,-0.067,0.026,-0.1,0.049,0.024,-0.035,0,-0.098,0.014,-0.061,-0.011,0.002,0.032,-0.011,-0.02,-0.067,-0.051,-0.009,0.045,-0.148,0.048,-0.002,0.001,0.02,-0.046,-0.034,0.007,0.021,0.076,0.033,-0.068,-0.037,-0.046,-0.008,0.106,0.109,-0.011,0.022,0.011,-0.064,-0.017,0.043,-0.032,0.069,-0.021,-0.049,-0.025,-0.033,0.019,-0.042,0.061,-0.009,0.005,0.064,0.044,0.045,-0.003,0.027,0,-0.018,0.074,0.048,0.054,0.078,-0.052,0.059,-0.015,0.011,-0.021,0.055,0.058,0.012,-0.037,-0.026,0.027,-0.065,0.118,-0.031,0.059,0.076,-0.114,-0.04,-0.014,0.008,-0.105,-0.081,-0.044,-0.073,-0.016,-0.033,0.041,-0.036,-0.057,-0.002,0.012,0.059,-0.006,0.003,-0.009,0.021,0.017,-0.053,0,-0.001,-0.002,-0.048,-0.019,0.019,0.013,0.004,-0.042,-0.033,-0.011,0.114,0.055,0.02,-0.082,-0.017,0.031,-0.045,-0.02,-0.066,0.027,0.02,-0.062,-0.02,-0.039,0.024,0.037,-0.044,0.009,0.038,0.022,0.035,-0.001,0.058,0.048,0.027,0.071,0.034,-0.024,0.034,0.114,-0.018,0.005,0.016,0.065,0.055,0.09,-0.117,-0.063,-0.036,-0.018,0.012,0.018,-0.079,-0.022,0.035,-0.028,-0.019,-0.03,0.131,0.054,0.037,0.003,0.045,0.004]},{"id":"rule_capacity_main","type":"rule","category":"miscellaneous","title":"Capacity (Attribute)","section":"rules_reference","content":"Capacity is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.\n\n• A unit's capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport.\n    \n• The combined capacity values of a player's ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system's space area.\n    \n• If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units.\n\n• A player can choose which of their excess units to remove.\n        \n• Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity.\n        \n• A player's fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat.

When a player receives a commodity from another player, the player who received that token converts it into a trade good by placing it in the trade good area of their command sheet with the trade good side faceup.\n\n• That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.\n        \n• A player can trade commodity tokens before resolving a game effect that allows them to replenish commodities.\n        \n• If a game effect instructs a player to convert a number of their own commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.\n\n• Any game effect that instructs a player to give a commodity to another player causes that commodity to be converted into a trade good.\n    \n• A player cannot spend commodities unless otherwise specified; a player can only trade them during a transaction.\n    \n• Commodity tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":21,"keywords":["player","commodity","trade","commodities","good","tokens","token","goods","faction","game"],"crossReferences":["Deals","Trade","Trade Goods","Transactions"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.093,-0.015,-0.033,-0.014,0.016,0.033,0.052,-0.001,0.035,0.042,-0.01,-0.049,0.07,-0.002,0.065,-0.008,0.049,0.09,-0.116,0.019,0.136,-0.066,-0.083,-0.056,-0.035,-0.011,-0.031,-0.049,-0.016,-0.028,-0.058,0.101,-0.005,0.02,-0.079,0.089,-0.031,0.028,0.001,-0.019,0.004,0,-0.007,-0.045,-0.012,-0.043,0.066,-0.038,-0.045,-0.016,-0.036,0.042,-0.093,0.115,0.018,0.013,0.003,-0.039,0.005,-0.013,-0.03,-0.055,0.006,-0.056,0.104,-0.072,-0.039,0.053,-0.12,0.028,0.019,-0.029,-0.111,-0.063,0.035,0.065,0.07,0.017,-0.003,-0.092,0.038,0.122,0.013,-0.08,-0.006,-0.077,-0.001,-0.043,0.117,0.079,0.007,-0.013,0.091,0.046,0.094,-0.009,0.005,-0.006,0.071,0.067,0.029,0.016,0.014,-0.021,-0.007,0.005,-0.075,0.042,-0.024,0.01,-0.033,0.057,-0.097,-0.032,-0.077,0.055,0.02,-0.012,-0.028,-0.008,0.043,-0.035,0.045,0.033,-0.076,0.002,0,0,-0.129,-0.081,-0.025,-0.013,-0.041,-0.008,-0.027,0.016,-0.036,-0.012,-0.059,0.192,-0.018,0.141,0.006,-0.057,-0.036,-0.03,0.143,-0.025,0.037,0.016,-0.021,0.01,-0.008,0.043,-0.008,-0.068,-0.016,0.01,0.008,-0.023,0.071,-0.005,0.023,0.096,-0.022,-0.004,-0.035,-0.114,-0.056,0,-0.032,0.052,-0.029,-0.033,0.034,0.015,-0.03,0.016,0.045,0.037,0.067,-0.074,-0.021,-0.066,-0.005,0.022,-0.065,0.04,0.004,0.001,0.077,0.032,-0.061,0.123,-0.007,-0.046,0.035,-0.07,-0.048,0.084,-0.009,0.079,-0.025,-0.005,0.022,0.057,-0.011,-0.029,-0.094,-0.041,-0.044,0.026,-0.151,-0.036,-0.014,-0.103,0.022,-0.111,0.033,0.029,-0.021,0.099,0.112,0,-0.001,0.009,-0.021,0.036,-0.018,-0.046,0.043,-0.004,0.004,0.014,-0.083,0.002,-0.015,-0.025,-0.014,-0.036,-0.074,0.063,-0.034,-0.005,-0.04,0.112,-0.045,0.014,-0.017,0.074,-0.07,-0.042,0.025,0.032,0.067,-0.046,-0.039,-0.051,-0.021,-0.034,0.021,0.016,-0.036,0.031,0.072,0.012,0.025,0.085,-0.037,-0.028,0.07,-0.022,0.089,-0.03,0.08,0.04,-0.016,-0.05,-0.04,0.026,0.041,-0.03,0.044,-0.04,0.015,0.041,0.035,0.017,0.061,0.007,-0.018,-0.074,0.049,-0.008,0.019,0.009,-0.008,-0.062,0.106,0.056,0.002,-0.054,-0.042,-0.036,-0.093,-0.011,0.069,0.036,-0.019,-0.04,0.011,0.039,0.041,0.022,-0.06,-0.042,0.008,0.018,-0.039,0,-0.062,-0.03,-0.019,0.065,-0.056,-0.007,-0.005,-0.013,-0.038,0.066,0,0.036,-0.12,-0.079,0.006,0.039,0.015,-0.024,-0.067,-0.002,0,-0.002,0.002,-0.033,0.027,-0.042,-0.003,0.04,0.029,-0.021,0.043,0.023,-0.006,0.004,0.022,0.053,-0.019,-0.027,-0.025,0.03,-0.062,-0.01,-0.047,0.011,0.043,0.048,-0.105,0.019,-0.006,0.029,-0.054,-0.037,-0.042,-0.03,-0.004,-0.028,-0.01,0.079,0.079,-0.075,0.014,-0.032,-0.019,-0.021]},{"id":"rule_commodities_notes","type":"rule","category":"resources","title":"Commodities - Notes","section":"notes","content":"• A player starts the game with zero commodities.\n    \n• If a player has their maximum number of commodities, and is instructed to replenish their commodities, they will take no commodities.

If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that roll produces a hit.\n\n• If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.\n\n• Step 2 - Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose one of their own ground forces on the planet to be destroyed for each hit result their opponent produced.\n\n• When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.\n\n• After assigning hits, if both players still have ground forces on the planet, players resolve a new combat round starting with the Roll Dice step.\n    \n• Ground combat ends when only one player (or neither player) has ground forces on the planet.\n\n• During the first round of a combat, \"start of combat\" and \"start of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n        \n• During the last round of a combat, \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n        \n• After a combat ends, the player with one or more ground forces remaining on the planet is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat.\n        \n• If neither player has a ground force remaining, there is no winner; the combat ends in a draw.\n\n• The \"start of combat\" and \"start of combat round\" windows occur before the Roll Dice step.\n    \n• The \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" windows occur after the Assign Hits step.\n    \n• If ground combat is to happen on multiple planets during a single invasion step, they will be resolved planet by planet, after the Space Cannon Defense step has been resolved on all planets and before the Establish Control step is resolved on any planet.

Establish Control: The active player gains control of each planet they committed ground forces to if that planet still contains at least one of their ground forces.\n\n• When a player gains control of a planet, any structures on the planet that belong to other players are immediately destroyed.\n        \n• When a player gains control of a planet, they gain the planet card that matches that planet and exhaust that card.\n        \n• A player cannot gain control of a planet they already control.\n        \n• If there was a combat, and all units belonging to both players were destroyed, the player who was the defender retains control of the planet and places one of their control tokens on the planet.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":49,"keywords":["player","planet","ground","active","forces","control","step","those","space","players"],"crossReferences":["Active Player","Bombardment","Combat","Control","Custodians Token","Exploration","Ground Combat","Ground Forces","Planets","Space Cannon"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.029,0.033,0.017,-0.022,0.05,0.013,0.117,0.047,0.001,0.092,0.016,-0.053,0.077,-0.066,0.031,0.001,-0.033,0.028,-0.085,0.031,0.025,-0.03,0.06,0.041,-0.073,-0.014,-0.071,0.007,-0.088,-0.072,0.007,0.06,0.04,0.001,-0.056,0.077,0.015,0,-0.08,0.03,-0.005,0.009,0.07,0.008,0.007,0.057,-0.092,0.007,-0.02,-0.029,-0.043,0,-0.044,0.101,0.058,-0.036,0.043,-0.016,0.043,-0.099,-0.01,-0.013,-0.075,-0.017,0.04,-0.041,0.027,0.042,-0.026,0.107,-0.007,-0.044,-0.044,-0.107,0.047,0.107,0.004,0.094,0.041,-0.088,0.04,0.066,-0.055,-0.041,-0.07,-0.056,-0.032,-0.056,0.153,0.055,0.013,-0.03,0.077,0.014,0.02,-0.06,0.051,-0.123,0.06,0.082,0.02,-0.043,-0.037,-0.028,0.006,0.021,-0.031,0.002,-0.033,-0.022,-0.017,-0.028,-0.064,-0.039,-0.032,0.039,0.097,-0.006,-0.005,-0.106,0.022,-0.079,0.059,-0.002,-0.011,-0.074,-0.098,0,0.02,-0.068,0.026,0.033,-0.029,-0.024,-0.004,0.002,-0.07,0.044,-0.03,0.024,0.061,0.028,0.064,0.006,0.007,-0.004,0.012,0.036,0.062,0.069,-0.052,-0.004,0.045,-0.012,-0.043,-0.057,-0.115,-0.01,-0.034,-0.031,0.017,0.082,0.017,0.032,-0.02,-0.069,-0.022,-0.088,-0.1,-0.07,-0.017,-0.044,0.034,-0.039,-0.031,-0.009,0.01,0.073,0.044,0.029,0.017,-0.063,0.02,-0.004,-0.052,0.066,-0.036,0.11,0.021,-0.044,0.021,0.003,0.009,0.076,-0.122,-0.023,0.081,-0.075,-0.09,0.077,0.072,0.049,0.036,-0.02,0,-0.071,-0.028,0.01,-0.106,-0.029,-0.063,0.031,-0.113,-0.05,0.008,-0.04,-0.062,-0.054,0.001,-0.079,0.053,0.043,-0.02,0,0.036,-0.021,-0.044,-0.048,-0.007,0.015,-0.033,-0.026,-0.07,-0.063,-0.066,0.062,-0.024,-0.012,-0.013,-0.02,-0.011,-0.008,-0.013,0.073,0.026,0.043,0.039,-0.014,0.024,-0.018,0.01,0.159,0.056,0.037,0.009,-0.065,-0.068,-0.017,-0.007,-0.034,0.096,0.069,-0.052,0.018,-0.019,0.002,0.002,0.054,-0.019,-0.011,0.061,0.076,-0.095,-0.011,0.004,-0.079,-0.024,-0.003,-0.019,0.066,0.098,0.02,0.007,0.013,0.053,-0.012,0.032,0.061,0.017,-0.024,-0.064,0.089,-0.023,0.042,-0.04,0.034,0.043,-0.005,0.109,-0.038,0.024,-0.101,0.002,-0.044,-0.069,-0.022,0.014,0.068,-0.051,0.047,0.006,-0.01,0.019,-0.027,-0.028,0.01,0.057,0.025,-0.034,0,0.015,0.042,0.001,0.017,0.039,0.023,0.036,-0.071,-0.035,-0.018,0.088,0.082,0.017,-0.12,0.001,-0.017,-0.032,-0.029,-0.12,0.002,-0.015,-0.074,-0.044,0.006,0.025,0.021,0.002,-0.013,0.016,0.02,0.036,0.006,-0.011,0.059,0.028,0.076,0.017,-0.074,0.029,0.06,-0.086,0.045,-0.025,0.021,-0.005,0.077,-0.077,-0.103,-0.013,-0.02,0.005,0.001,-0.067,0.076,0.007,0.054,0.013,0.018,0.076,0.062,-0.003,0.062,0.025,0.02]},{"id":"rule_invasion_notes","type":"rule","category":"combat","title":"Invasion -

The ability card will not be exhausted if it was readied.\n    \n• If Mecatol Rex has the custodians token on it, a player must remove it before they may commit ground forces to it.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":49,"keywords":["planet","player","ground","forces","active","control","step","those","commit","space"],"crossReferences":["Active Player","Bombardment","Combat","Control","Custodians Token","Exploration","Ground Combat","Ground Forces","Planets","Space Cannon"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.034,0.038,0.018,-0.002,0.054,0.016,0.113,0.038,0.028,0.092,0.019,-0.048,0.073,-0.071,0.03,-0.005,-0.025,0.018,-0.084,0.043,0.024,-0.027,0.056,0.05,-0.094,-0.017,-0.096,0.004,-0.067,-0.063,0.01,0.066,0.037,0.005,-0.057,0.091,0.028,-0.009,-0.086,0.022,0.001,0.015,0.069,0.013,0.005,0.039,-0.095,0.005,-0.032,-0.034,-0.03,-0.001,-0.031,0.093,0.047,-0.021,0.042,-0.013,0.042,-0.096,-0.009,-0.011,-0.076,-0.024,0.048,-0.052,0.028,0.035,-0.021,0.088,0.017,-0.046,-0.043,-0.115,0.047,0.113,-0.009,0.097,0.035,-0.09,0.053,0.076,-0.036,-0.051,-0.074,-0.045,-0.024,-0.06,0.157,0.062,0.023,-0.041,0.066,0.012,0.022,-0.063,0.048,-0.123,0.06,0.08,0.025,-0.033,-0.052,-0.03,0.001,0.014,-0.04,-0.014,-0.041,-0.019,-0.008,-0.042,-0.049,-0.042,-0.036,0.038,0.103,-0.024,-0.012,-0.116,0.023,-0.084,0.057,-0.006,-0.006,-0.067,-0.107,0,0.023,-0.067,0.019,0.025,-0.036,-0.026,-0.017,0.001,-0.056,0.036,-0.046,0.018,0.061,0.033,0.068,0.016,0.01,0.003,0.016,0.04,0.067,0.087,-0.051,-0.004,0.04,-0.02,-0.046,-0.038,-0.127,-0.012,-0.037,-0.029,0.023,0.094,0.02,0.039,-0.017,-0.066,-0.023,-0.08,-0.097,-0.058,-0.022,-0.042,0.039,-0.045,-0.015,-0.004,0.001,0.067,0.053,0.036,0.001,-0.059,0.013,0.013,-0.049,0.052,-0.035,0.114,0.021,-0.063,0.015,0.014,0.009,0.086,-0.107,-0.028,0.067,-0.078,-0.094,0.064,0.065,0.04,0.046,-0.026,-0.009,-0.056,-0.026,0.022,-0.108,-0.033,-0.068,0.045,-0.101,-0.051,0.013,-0.038,-0.056,-0.06,0.025,-0.066,0.051,0.035,-0.002,0,0.028,-0.026,-0.046,-0.047,-0.012,0.016,-0.038,-0.039,-0.081,-0.068,-0.071,0.064,-0.028,-0.002,-0.015,-0.031,0.005,-0.007,-0.016,0.08,0.045,0.04,0.051,-0.024,0.034,-0.022,-0.011,0.154,0.051,0.034,0.024,-0.063,-0.088,-0.006,-0.002,-0.026,0.086,0.077,-0.052,0.024,-0.021,0.002,-0.013,0.061,-0.004,-0.014,0.057,0.081,-0.076,-0.02,0.012,-0.06,-0.004,0.009,-0.012,0.062,0.094,0.013,0.009,0.02,0.054,-0.019,0.019,0.062,0.012,-0.023,-0.051,0.093,-0.022,0.047,-0.038,0.027,0.048,-0.012,0.102,-0.022,0.02,-0.111,0.003,-0.04,-0.08,-0.016,0.021,0.058,-0.047,0.035,-0.01,-0.016,0.02,-0.013,-0.021,0.008,0.051,0.034,-0.034,0,0.011,0.045,-0.004,0.01,0.035,0.022,0.038,-0.074,-0.035,-0.003,0.086,0.078,0.013,-0.119,-0.007,-0.009,-0.014,-0.037,-0.118,0.013,-0.005,-0.077,-0.052,0,0.018,0.008,0.01,-0.014,0.019,0.03,0.04,0.005,-0.013,0.07,0.032,0.068,0.008,-0.062,0.034,0.057,-0.081,0.049,-0.025,0.021,0.001,0.081,-0.088,-0.102,-0.011,-0.006,0.007,0.002,-0.067,0.075,0.005,0.047,0.022,0.021,0.069,0.057,-0.011,0.042,0.027,0.002]},{"id":"rule_leader_sheet_main","type":"rule","category":"miscellaneous","title":"Leader Sheet","section":"rules_reference","content":"Each player has a leader sheet that contains slots for their faction's three leader cards as well as their faction's mech unit card. \n\n• The leader slots of the leader sheet are where players place their three leader cards during setup.

A ship may move \"through\" other systems.\n    \n• Fighters alone will block other player's ships from moving through that system, whether they are accompanied by a Space Dock or they are Fighters II.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":58,"keywords":["player","move","system","ship","from","action","movement","ships","tactical","unit"],"crossReferences":["Active System","Adjacency","Anomalies","Capacity","Hyperlanes","Move","Ships","Space Cannon","Tactical Action","Transport","Wormholes"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.023,-0.056,-0.034,0.027,0.027,0.027,0.075,-0.02,0.027,0.055,0.057,-0.036,0.081,-0.018,0.053,0.025,0.054,0.076,-0.06,0.028,0.057,-0.003,-0.045,0.042,-0.081,-0.015,-0.066,-0.052,-0.072,-0.094,-0.034,0.044,-0.056,0.037,-0.051,0.084,0.064,0.005,-0.017,-0.03,-0.053,-0.005,0.002,0.041,0.009,0.019,-0.041,-0.055,-0.074,0.028,-0.068,-0.032,-0.002,0.149,0.05,0.013,0.024,0.034,0.039,-0.026,0.002,0.018,-0.015,-0.017,-0.036,-0.084,0.01,0.056,-0.016,0.05,0.015,-0.009,-0.003,0.007,0.078,-0.035,0.057,0.081,0.072,-0.061,0.002,0.021,-0.041,-0.051,-0.037,0.004,-0.037,-0.01,0.05,0.071,-0.011,-0.077,0.098,0.006,0.094,-0.113,-0.015,-0.044,0.079,0.029,0.055,0.065,0.02,-0.001,-0.032,-0.005,0.022,-0.017,-0.014,-0.001,-0.012,0.004,-0.087,-0.046,-0.094,0.023,-0.037,0.001,0.015,-0.016,0.004,-0.081,0.099,0.037,0.012,-0.007,-0.028,0,-0.05,-0.107,-0.053,0.02,0.014,-0.034,-0.064,-0.038,-0.013,0.037,-0.086,0.041,0.049,0.099,0.041,-0.078,0.074,-0.024,0.044,-0.031,0.082,0.106,-0.07,-0.083,0.069,-0.002,-0.059,-0.043,-0.019,0.046,-0.058,0.033,-0.011,0.107,0.027,0.055,0.01,-0.084,-0.014,-0.092,-0.069,-0.057,-0.094,0.047,-0.026,-0.1,0.024,-0.055,-0.01,0.067,-0.004,0.001,0.03,-0.111,0.046,-0.11,0.017,0.067,-0.041,0.056,-0.084,-0.022,0.07,0.044,0.092,0.067,-0.107,-0.03,0.021,-0.062,-0.082,0.07,0.031,0.032,0.021,-0.071,0.017,0.012,-0.041,0.001,-0.119,-0.055,-0.061,0.1,-0.012,-0.014,-0.045,-0.016,-0.078,-0.062,0.003,-0.039,-0.007,0.106,0.042,0,0.013,0.041,-0.035,-0.027,-0.045,0.046,0,-0.024,0.004,-0.027,-0.14,0.019,-0.049,-0.008,-0.029,-0.048,0.033,0.037,-0.026,0.049,0.002,0.013,0.011,0.026,0.043,0.025,0.009,0.051,0.021,-0.016,0.035,-0.092,-0.015,-0.029,-0.002,-0.016,-0.068,0.133,-0.11,0.014,-0.003,-0.007,0.002,0.056,-0.008,0.052,0.045,-0.025,-0.079,0.022,-0.004,-0.047,-0.023,-0.03,0.039,0.083,0.046,-0.01,0.008,-0.055,0.148,-0.003,-0.005,0.012,0.017,0.007,-0.028,0.036,0.035,0.016,0.051,0.014,-0.024,0.037,0.073,-0.072,0.012,-0.091,-0.019,0.005,-0.03,-0.045,0.023,-0.009,-0.013,0.011,0.025,0.035,0.06,-0.038,0.026,0.012,0.034,-0.028,-0.068,0,0.007,0.019,-0.01,0.018,-0.047,0.014,0.024,-0.067,-0.032,0.053,0.01,0.088,-0.035,-0.09,0.01,-0.012,-0.011,-0.068,-0.077,-0.035,-0.041,-0.078,-0.03,0.061,-0.037,0.009,-0.057,0.005,0.079,0.008,0.05,0.019,-0.08,0.07,-0.031,0.071,0.047,-0.024,-0.017,0.045,-0.029,-0.019,-0.045,0.071,0.013,0.084,-0.058,-0.082,-0.04,-0.008,0.077,0.015,-0.071,0.125,-0.029,0.107,0.011,-0.004,0.072,0.017,-0.01,0.021,0.013,0]},{"id":"rule_nebula_main","type":"rule","category":"anomalies","title":"Nebula","section":"rules_reference","content":"A nebula is an anomaly that affects movement and combat.\n\n• A ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system.\n\n• A ship cannot move through a nebula.

However, they must immediately shuffle it into the secret objective deck.\n    \n• For notes about specific objective cards, see the objective card component notes page.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":61,"keywords":["objective","during","player","phase","score","secret","objectives","card","action","each"],"crossReferences":["Action Phase","Agenda Phase","Imperial","Status Phase","Victory Points"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.012,0.068,-0.067,-0.012,0.024,0.043,0.054,-0.031,0.057,0.078,-0.039,-0.032,0.065,-0.001,0.049,-0.028,0.038,0.042,-0.065,0.061,0.145,-0.035,-0.015,0.008,-0.039,-0.04,-0.008,-0.043,-0.033,-0.033,0.056,0.027,0.105,0.04,-0.058,0.036,0,-0.043,-0.029,-0.058,0.005,0.011,-0.029,-0.002,0.037,0.017,-0.052,-0.009,-0.108,-0.018,-0.044,0.046,-0.039,0.076,0.031,0.013,0.003,-0.044,-0.009,0.011,-0.008,-0.03,-0.042,-0.007,0.075,-0.018,0.037,-0.072,0.025,0.064,0.043,-0.028,0.026,-0.085,0.033,0.089,-0.022,-0.014,-0.011,-0.043,0.011,0.01,0.031,-0.023,0.03,-0.09,-0.003,-0.014,0.111,0.025,-0.053,0.048,0.068,0.037,0.127,-0.062,0.035,-0.037,0.042,0.065,-0.002,0.017,-0.038,-0.064,0.063,0.001,-0.01,-0.005,-0.019,-0.017,-0.034,-0.005,0.018,-0.074,-0.001,0.044,0.015,0.075,0.015,0.017,0.011,-0.07,0.096,-0.008,0.004,-0.011,-0.02,0,-0.058,-0.114,-0.009,-0.006,-0.068,0.022,0.011,-0.032,0.072,-0.032,0.019,0.071,0.008,0.078,0.164,-0.045,0.008,0.084,0.024,0.018,0.12,-0.014,-0.011,-0.07,0.059,0.05,0.021,-0.085,-0.097,0.037,0.023,-0.064,-0.055,0.087,-0.014,0.061,-0.019,0.001,0.02,-0.045,-0.069,-0.029,-0.024,-0.002,-0.092,-0.118,-0.025,0.03,-0.022,0.06,0.064,0.032,0.013,-0.122,-0.031,0.002,0.002,-0.015,-0.03,0.051,-0.013,-0.092,-0.061,-0.006,-0.019,0.127,-0.065,-0.08,0.051,-0.054,-0.058,0.052,0.045,-0.067,-0.073,0.001,0.057,0.04,-0.044,0,-0.067,0.013,-0.052,-0.041,0,0.013,0.022,-0.028,-0.157,-0.047,-0.003,0.002,-0.033,0.074,0.028,0,-0.068,-0.011,-0.116,-0.019,0.054,-0.012,-0.049,-0.032,-0.056,-0.027,-0.07,0.007,-0.051,0.023,-0.081,-0.062,0.012,0.041,-0.015,0.073,0.042,0.084,-0.041,-0.028,0.026,0.01,0.021,-0.005,0.077,0.001,0.091,-0.06,-0.116,0.021,-0.014,-0.014,-0.014,-0.016,-0.031,0.095,0.078,-0.005,-0.073,0.031,0.015,0.034,0.104,-0.018,-0.041,0.008,0.013,-0.051,-0.037,0.047,-0.088,0.001,0.01,-0.076,0.011,-0.012,0.096,0.05,-0.016,0.069,0.035,0.001,-0.014,-0.02,-0.011,0.006,-0.053,0.052,-0.022,0.019,0.02,0.058,-0.077,-0.016,-0.011,-0.093,-0.069,-0.036,-0.026,-0.008,0.009,-0.004,0.028,0.027,0.061,0.008,0.011,0.016,0.005,-0.027,-0.091,0,-0.076,0.01,-0.031,0.049,0.012,0.032,-0.007,-0.123,-0.011,-0.022,0.144,0.015,-0.074,-0.089,0.005,-0.011,0.009,-0.012,-0.056,-0.002,-0.02,-0.061,-0.046,0.025,0.003,0.027,-0.01,0.019,0.013,0.087,0.05,0.012,0.036,0.081,0.005,0.079,0.017,0.031,-0.013,0.097,-0.041,0.027,-0.061,0.024,0.072,0.064,-0.123,-0.041,-0.029,-0.033,-0.053,-0.024,-0.109,0.063,0.014,0.051,0.04,-0.025,0.036,0,0.078,0.054,-0.042,0.019]},{"id":"rule_opponent_main","type":"rule","category":"miscellaneous","title":"Opponent","section":"rules_reference","content":"During combat, a player's opponent is the other player that either has ships in the system at the start of the space combat or has ground forces on the planet at the start of a ground combat.\n\n• Players who do not have units on either side of a combat are not opponents.

To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit they are producing.\n\n• Spent resources must come from planets or trade goods that are controlled by the player who is producing the units.\n        \n• Any resources spent in excess of a unit's cost are lost.\n        \n• If a player is producing multiple units at a time, that player can add the cost of each unit they are producing to create a total cost before they spend any resources.\n\n• If the cost is accompanied by two icons - typically for fighters and infantry - a player produces two of that unit for that cost.\n\n• Each of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.\n        \n• A player can choose to produce only one unit; however, they must still pay the entire cost.\n\n• When a player produces a unit through the use of their units' Production abilities during a tactical action, that player follows the rules of the Production ability to determine where in the active system the units can be placed.\n    \n• When a player produces a unit through an ability outside of the tactical action, that ability will state how many units that player can produce and where that player can place those units.\n\n• A player cannot produce a unit on a planet they do not control.\n        \n• If an ability allows a player to produce a unit in a system, they may produce that unit in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.\n\n• A player is limited by the number of units in their reinforcements.\n\n• If a player cannot produce a unit because it is not in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. Then, that player can produce that unit. A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be produced immediately.\n        \n• When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece.\n\n• A player cannot produce ships in a system that contains other players' ships.\n\n• Ground forces can still be produced.\n\n• Whenever a unit is produced, its cost must be paid, unless the effect that is producing the unit explicitly says otherwise.\n    \n• A player cannot produce one fighter and one infantry for one resource.\n    \n• If an effect allows a player to produce a unit of a specific type, then factional variations do not prevent that player from producing that type of unit.\n    \n• If a player removes a unit in order to place it, because they have none of that unit type in their reinforcements, that unit is placed undamaged.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":67,"keywords":["player","unit","units","produce","cost","producing","any","one","system","produces"],"crossReferences":["Blockaded","Component Limitations","Cost","Fighter Tokens","Infantry Tokens","Production","Resources","Space Dock","Tactical Action","Units","Warfare"],"difficulty":"basic"},"embedding":[-0.048,-0.003,-0.048,0.034,0.029,0.03,0.038,-0.022,0.103,0.084,0.008,-0.077,0.16,-0.027,0,-0.039,0.001,0.011,-0.13,0.014,0.123,-0.086,-0.035,0.024,-0.037,-0.086,-0.047,-0.008,-0.023,-0.065,-0.032,0.102,0.076,-0.006,0.009,0.048,0.02,0.04,-0.022,0.036,-0.028,0.017,-0.015,0.038,-0.01,0.049,-0.044,-0.055,-0.109,0.021,-0.014,0.043,-0.07,0.056,0.039,-0.038,0.048,-0.047,-0.033,-0.037,-0.038,-0.014,-0.031,-0.099,0.077,-0.06,-0.018,0.053,-0.086,0.028,0.035,-0.029,-0.028,0.002,0.031,0.053,0.107,0.059,0.061,-0.025,0.059,0.088,-0.041,-0.082,-0.031,-0.003,0.047,-0.029,0.119,0.046,-0.028,0,0.082,-0.001,0.126,0.01,0.033,-0.047,0.056,0.013,0.038,-0.022,0.076,-0.042,-0.037,-0.033,-0.039,0.059,0.013,-0.002,0.031,-0.018,-0.089,-0.05,-0.015,0.026,0.055,-0.048,0.013,0.002,0.019,-0.052,0.024,0.047,-0.018,-0.023,-0.027,0,-0.048,-0.118,-0.032,-0.017,-0.045,-0.022,-0.025,0.023,0.031,-0.026,-0.071,0.087,0.011,0.12,0.119,-0.04,0.049,0.052,0.073,0.002,-0.003,0.09,-0.009,-0.029,0.039,0.009,-0.028,-0.032,-0.114,-0.003,0.004,0.033,0.006,0.054,-0.004,0.023,-0.011,-0.017,-0.032,-0.034,-0.065,0.001,0.005,0.012,-0.044,-0.019,0.051,-0.032,-0.065,0.017,0.006,0.084,0.043,-0.126,0.059,-0.021,0.025,-0.012,-0.017,0.077,-0.11,-0.003,0.016,0.107,-0.013,0.029,-0.032,-0.049,0.07,-0.063,-0.103,-0.006,0.042,-0.015,0.004,-0.018,0.031,0.013,-0.081,0.029,-0.121,0.018,-0.065,-0.019,-0.05,-0.065,0.018,0.005,-0.022,-0.061,0.034,-0.063,-0.056,0.037,0.036,0,-0.022,0.029,-0.059,-0.073,-0.002,0.019,-0.027,-0.063,-0.087,-0.022,-0.144,0.013,-0.055,-0.012,-0.122,-0.059,0.002,-0.023,0.006,0.052,0.014,0.034,0.051,-0.041,0.002,0.038,-0.066,0.07,0.04,0.002,0.072,-0.121,-0.065,-0.022,-0.016,-0.036,0,0.074,-0.024,0.027,0.033,-0.034,0.008,0.07,0.002,-0.068,0.095,-0.095,0.008,-0.025,0.068,-0.04,-0.056,-0.046,-0.047,0.003,0.065,0.013,0.053,-0.013,0.06,-0.027,-0.007,0.064,-0.008,0.032,0.002,0.052,0.031,0.04,-0.052,0.055,0.022,-0.03,0.007,0.058,-0.07,-0.081,0.011,-0.043,-0.086,-0.048,0.025,-0.023,-0.011,-0.033,0.065,0.043,0.049,0.002,-0.001,-0.017,-0.008,0.046,-0.041,0,-0.025,0.028,0.028,0.05,-0.001,-0.073,0.065,-0.057,-0.009,0.114,0.037,0.019,-0.023,-0.037,0.04,0.034,-0.028,0.017,-0.062,-0.044,-0.005,0.005,-0.064,0.027,-0.004,-0.008,-0.033,0.018,0.031,0.046,0.108,0.015,-0.041,0.039,0.053,-0.033,-0.031,-0.057,-0.003,0.053,-0.056,0.005,-0.035,0.044,0.079,0.062,-0.154,-0.093,-0.059,-0.011,0.02,-0.004,-0.052,0.021,0.021,0.009,0.04,0.028,0.06,-0.008,-0.005,0.004,0.087,-0.008]},{"id":"rule_production_main","type":"rule","category":"production","title":"Production (Unit Ability)","section":"rules_reference","content":"During the Production step of a tactical action, the active player can resolve the Production ability of each of their units that are in the active system to produce units\n\n• A unit's Production ability, which is presented on a faction sheet or unit upgrade technology card, is always followed by a value.

This includes units in adjacent systems, if applicable.\n\n• A player that chooses to use the Space Cannon ability of their units may choose whether or not they use the ability of the Plasma Scoring technology, if they own it, and any similar abilities, independent of one another.\n\n• A player may use the Sustain Damage ability of a ship in the active system to cancel a hit produced during the Space Cannon Offense step.\n    \n• A player may use the Sustain Damage ability of a mech committed to a planet to cancel a hit produced during the Space Cannon Defense step by a unit on that planet.\n    \n• If multiple players are resolving the Space Cannon ability of their units against the active player, the active player must resolve capacity limits after assigning one player's hits and before the next player makes their space cannon roll. \n    \n• A player cannot assign hits produced by a space cannon roll to their own units.\n    \n• The \"0\" side of the d10 represents a result of 10.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":77,"keywords":["space","cannon","player","ability","use","units","during","active","step","unit"],"crossReferences":["Abilities","Active Player","Active System","Adjacency","Destroyed","Invasion","Movement","PDS","Sustain Damage"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.09,0.059,-0.028,-0.04,-0.013,-0.011,0.103,0.106,-0.039,-0.001,0.008,-0.031,0.062,0.005,-0.018,-0.057,0.033,0.048,-0.106,0.051,0.062,-0.015,-0.003,-0.003,-0.046,0.004,-0.028,-0.035,-0.103,-0.023,0.025,0.024,0.025,-0.005,0.027,0.022,0.022,0.038,-0.045,0.057,-0.034,-0.032,-0.01,0.067,0.017,0.016,-0.09,-0.063,-0.055,0.085,-0.07,0.042,-0.035,0.167,0.124,-0.025,-0.009,0.067,-0.032,-0.058,-0.047,-0.058,-0.013,0,0.015,-0.049,0.011,0.033,-0.036,0.079,0.052,0.055,-0.039,-0.069,0.044,0.063,0.031,0.065,0.074,-0.048,0.048,0.061,-0.095,-0.082,-0.039,0.011,-0.022,-0.049,0.109,0.06,-0.013,-0.052,0.009,-0.013,0.032,-0.076,0.027,-0.077,0.037,0.042,-0.007,-0.035,-0.052,-0.019,0.043,-0.043,-0.002,-0.002,-0.02,-0.043,0.046,-0.049,-0.056,-0.043,0.018,-0.021,-0.025,-0.039,-0.02,-0.103,-0.043,-0.138,0.077,-0.016,-0.055,0.021,-0.04,0,-0.006,-0.058,-0.015,0.023,-0.067,-0.01,-0.073,0.083,-0.084,-0.014,-0.056,0.103,0.006,0.093,0.1,0.046,0.062,0.056,-0.004,0.032,0.108,0.074,-0.033,-0.054,0.046,0.046,-0.062,-0.005,-0.154,0.034,-0.073,0.015,0.038,0.025,0.01,0.03,-0.066,-0.012,-0.048,-0.072,-0.094,-0.052,-0.071,-0.051,0.024,-0.06,0.005,-0.035,-0.024,0.041,0.027,0.064,0.003,-0.02,0.092,0.026,-0.009,0.019,-0.012,0.062,-0.027,-0.015,0.02,0.032,0.003,0.065,-0.068,0.001,0.099,-0.097,-0.037,0.021,0.025,-0.017,0.088,0.026,0.057,0.022,-0.057,0.002,-0.101,-0.031,-0.065,0.008,-0.08,0.025,0.032,-0.001,-0.14,-0.028,0.037,-0.007,-0.006,0.047,-0.049,0,0.035,0.011,-0.111,-0.033,-0.001,0.035,0.085,-0.022,-0.033,-0.042,-0.078,0.006,-0.04,-0.046,-0.027,-0.029,-0.046,0.041,-0.013,0.038,0.105,0.043,0.032,0.025,0.005,0.015,0.015,0.037,0,-0.016,0.023,-0.036,-0.047,0.016,0.025,-0.034,0.084,0.02,-0.05,-0.043,0.01,0.06,-0.037,0.042,-0.065,0.042,0.065,0.017,-0.021,0.004,0.034,-0.14,0,0.036,-0.037,0.069,0.048,0.051,0.014,0.086,0.109,-0.038,0.045,0.051,-0.042,-0.012,-0.023,0.057,-0.051,0.01,0.059,0.041,0.075,0.034,0.032,-0.025,-0.03,-0.044,-0.011,-0.023,-0.076,-0.028,-0.05,0.047,-0.029,-0.018,0.02,-0.044,0.008,-0.046,0.014,0.061,-0.044,0.008,0.004,0,0.022,0.017,0.003,0.011,0.003,-0.055,0.053,-0.015,0.026,-0.023,0.134,0.032,-0.018,-0.09,-0.004,-0.017,0.001,-0.089,-0.088,0.036,0.001,-0.032,-0.051,-0.011,-0.048,-0.016,0.013,-0.018,0.051,-0.074,0.01,-0.04,-0.033,0.101,0.027,0.103,0.016,0.006,-0.014,0.095,-0.09,-0.007,0.045,0.044,0,0.061,-0.053,-0.051,-0.062,0.007,0.037,0.038,-0.071,0.004,-0.029,0.057,0.004,0.021,-0.006,0.066,0.033,0.049,0.034,0.035]},{"id":"rule_space_combat_main","type":"rule","category":"combat","title":"Space Combat","section":"rules_reference","content":"After resolving the Space Cannon Offense step of a tactical action, if two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.\n\n• If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip the Space Combat step of the tactical action and proceeds to the Invasion step.\n    \n• If an ability occurs \"before combat\", it occurs immediately before the Anti-Fighter Barrage step.\n\n• During the first round of a combat, \"start of combat\" and \"start of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n        \n• During the last round of a combat, \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n\nTo resolve a space combat, players perform the following steps:\n\n• Step 1 - Anti-Fighter Barrage: If this is the first round of a space combat, the players may simultaneously use the Anti-Fighter Barrage ability of any of their units in the active system.\n\n• If one or both players no longer have ships in the active system after resolving this step, the space combat ends immediately.\n        \n• Players cannot resolve Anti-Fighter Barrage abilities during any rounds of space combat other than the first round.\n        \n• This step still occurs if no fighters are present.\n\n• Step 2 - Announce Retreats: Each player may announce a retreat, beginning with the defender.\n\n• A retreat will not occur immediately; the units retreat during the Retreat step.\n        \n• If the defender announces a retreat, the attacker cannot announce a retreat during that combat round.\n        \n• A player cannot announce a retreat if there is not at least one eligible system to retreat to.\n\n• Step 3 - Roll Dice: Each player rolls one die for each ship they have in the active system; this is called a combat roll. If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that result produces a hit.\n\n• If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.\n        \n• If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, that player rolls these dice separately.\n        \n• First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value of \"1\". Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value of \"2\", and then \"3\", continuing in numerical order until that player has rolled dice for each of their ships.\n        \n• The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce. The total number of hits produced will destroy units during the Assign Hits step.\n        \n• If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after it is rolled, that player must resolve such an ability immediately after rolling all of their dice.\n        \n• The attacker makes all of their combat rolls during this step before the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent's die.\n\n• Step 4 - Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.\n\n• Before assigning hits, players may use their units' Sustain Damage abilities to cancel hits.\n        \n• When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.\n\n• Step 5 - Retreat: If a player announced a retreat during step 2, and there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must retreat.\n\n• If a player announced a retreat during the Announce Retreats step, but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.\n        \n• To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active system. That player's fighters and ground forces in the space area of the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.\n        \n• The system that a player's units retreat to must contain one or more of that player's units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.\n        \n• If any of a player's units successfully retreat and are moved into an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.\n\n• After the Retreat step, if both players still have ships in the active system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with the Announce Retreats step.\n    \n• Space combat ends when only one player - or neither player - has a ship in the space area of the active system.\n\n• During the last round of a combat, \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n\n• After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.\n\n• If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any excess units.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":78,"keywords":["combat","player","system","step","retreat","space","during","units","ships","active"],"crossReferences":["Anti-Fighter Barrage","Attacker","Capacity","Defender","Destroyed","Fleet Pool","Opponent","Sustain Damage","Tactical Action"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.068,0.029,-0.003,0.016,-0.008,0.022,0.04,0.024,0.069,0.059,0.026,-0.065,0.047,-0.053,0.011,-0.014,-0.077,0.008,-0.052,0.009,0.048,-0.036,-0.011,-0.012,-0.027,-0.001,-0.062,0.017,-0.075,-0.058,0.001,0.044,0.058,0.001,-0.04,-0.014,0.055,0.019,-0.035,0.045,-0.038,-0.014,0.057,0.056,0.074,-0.003,-0.112,-0.036,-0.005,-0.007,-0.052,0.025,-0.056,0.13,0.103,-0.067,0.011,0.01,-0.012,-0.066,-0.063,-0.062,-0.07,0.007,0.047,-0.058,0.031,0.032,0.007,0.112,-0.102,0.017,-0.056,-0.02,0.028,0.068,0.032,0.054,0.043,-0.05,0.017,0.033,-0.037,-0.046,-0.026,-0.064,0.001,-0.039,0.133,0.092,-0.001,0.012,-0.009,0.007,0.049,-0.003,0.045,-0.048,0.078,0.056,0.017,-0.081,-0.005,-0.053,0.04,-0.004,-0.009,0.019,-0.059,-0.093,-0.005,-0.019,-0.028,-0.047,-0.054,0.069,0.039,-0.015,0.064,-0.083,0.04,-0.046,0.057,-0.017,0,-0.021,0.001,0,-0.014,-0.151,-0.029,0.03,-0.025,-0.023,-0.054,0.016,-0.028,0.054,-0.056,0.033,0.034,0.006,0.083,-0.034,0.027,0.026,-0.062,-0.006,0.091,-0.02,-0.062,-0.011,0.02,0.086,-0.037,-0.038,-0.085,0.034,-0.039,0.027,-0.021,0.03,0.054,0.038,0.009,-0.005,-0.019,-0.028,-0.114,-0.023,-0.052,-0.058,-0.007,-0.089,-0.021,-0.011,0.081,0.081,0.063,0.021,-0.01,-0.005,0.105,0.078,0.031,0.042,-0.071,0.138,-0.043,-0.063,0.019,-0.01,0,0.073,-0.108,-0.028,0.053,-0.05,-0.039,0.054,0.09,-0.013,0.043,-0.028,0.062,0.067,-0.012,-0.022,-0.059,-0.016,-0.085,-0.004,-0.096,0.007,0.043,-0.049,-0.17,-0.113,-0.012,-0.029,0.086,0.038,-0.027,0,0.029,-0.005,-0.017,-0.042,0.024,0.055,0.018,-0.004,0.016,-0.016,-0.034,0.039,-0.083,-0.024,0.017,-0.033,0.054,-0.043,-0.048,0.052,0.112,0.003,-0.022,-0.024,0.001,-0.018,0.036,0.071,0.053,0.014,0.067,-0.079,-0.025,0.018,0.027,-0.052,0.072,-0.001,-0.05,0.045,0.075,-0.021,-0.046,0.055,-0.014,-0.004,0.066,0.028,-0.046,-0.056,-0.007,-0.1,-0.024,0.038,-0.077,0.024,0.031,-0.02,0.024,0.042,0.045,-0.038,0.046,0.02,0.012,-0.021,-0.092,0.047,-0.039,0.04,-0.001,0.012,-0.032,-0.048,0.008,-0.036,-0.025,-0.1,0.006,0.004,-0.103,-0.016,-0.011,0.064,-0.097,-0.012,0.048,0.004,0.029,-0.001,-0.024,0.045,0.047,0.05,-0.054,0,-0.056,-0.013,-0.023,0.072,0.015,0.037,0.016,-0.038,-0.059,-0.033,0.128,0.097,0.021,-0.116,0.001,0.02,-0.053,-0.036,-0.092,0.024,-0.029,-0.055,-0.047,-0.065,-0.043,0.082,0.008,0.043,0.029,-0.034,0.025,0.025,-0.036,0.083,-0.031,0.095,0.08,-0.067,0.018,0.075,-0.073,-0.015,0.007,0.033,0.002,0.107,-0.071,-0.032,-0.079,-0.04,0.013,-0.015,-0.111,0.03,-0.021,0.041,0.021,-0.002,0.053,0.028,-0.013,0.009,0.02,0.063]},{"id":"rule_space_combat_notes","type":"rule","category":"combat","title":"Space Combat - Notes","section":"notes","content":"• A player's fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat.

If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that result produces a hit.\n\n• If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.\n        \n• If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, that player rolls these dice separately.\n        \n• First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value of \"1\". Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value of \"2\", and then \"3\", continuing in numerical order until that player has rolled dice for each of their ships.\n        \n• The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce. The total number of hits produced will destroy units during the Assign Hits step.\n        \n• If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after it is rolled, that player must resolve such an ability immediately after rolling all of their dice.\n        \n• The attacker makes all of their combat rolls during this step before the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent's die.\n\n• Step 4 - Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.\n\n• Before assigning hits, players may use their units' Sustain Damage abilities to cancel hits.\n        \n• When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.\n\n• Step 5 - Retreat: If a player announced a retreat during step 2, and there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must retreat.\n\n• If a player announced a retreat during the Announce Retreats step, but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.\n        \n• To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active system. That player's fighters and ground forces in the space area of the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.\n        \n• The system that a player's units retreat to must contain one or more of that player's units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.\n        \n• If any of a player's units successfully retreat and are moved into an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.\n\n• After the Retreat step, if both players still have ships in the active system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with the Announce Retreats step.\n    \n• Space combat ends when only one player - or neither player - has a ship in the space area of the active system.\n\n• During the last round of a combat, \"end of combat\" and \"end of combat round\" effects occur during the same timing window.\n\n• After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.\n\n• If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any excess units.\n\n• A player's fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player's reinforcements.\n    \n• A player may retreat into an asteroid field only if that player owns the Antimass Deflectors technology.\n    \n• A player may retreat into a supernova only if that player owns the Magmus Reactor Muaat factional technology.\n    \n• A player cannot retreat into a nebula.\n\n• The Empyrean player may retreat into a nebula.\n        \n• The Shared Research law will not allow a player to retreat into a nebula.\n\n• A player may attempt to retreat from a combat in a gravity rift, but will still be affected by it. See the gravity rift page for more details.\n    \n• If a player only has fighters I in the combat when they retreat, those will be removed from the board, and they will not place a command token in an adjacent system.\n    \n• The Nav Suite action card will not allow a player to ignore an anomaly while retreating.\n    \n• The Dark Energy Tap technology allows a player to retreat into a system that does not contain their ships or a planet they control.\n    \n• Modifying the move value of a ship will have no effect when retreating.

To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:\n\n• Step 1 - Score Objectives: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory points indicated on the card.\n    \n• Step 2 - Reveal Public Objective: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.\n\n• The speaker cannot reveal \"Stage II\" objectives until all \"Stage I\" objectives are revealed.\n        \n• The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.\n\n• Step 3 - Draw Action Cards: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.\n    \n• Step 4 - Remove Command Tokens: Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board. Each player returns each removed token to their reinforcements.\n    \n• Step 5 - Gain and Redistribute Command Tokens: Each player gains two command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements. Then, each player can redistribute each command token on their command sheet, including the two they just gained, among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.\n\n• Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.\n        \n• This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.\n\n• Step 6 - Ready Cards: Each player readies all of their exhausted cards, including strategy cards.\n    \n• Step 7 - Repair Units: Each player repairs all of their damaged units by turning those units upright.\n    \n• Step 8 - Return Strategy Cards: Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase.

To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:\n\n• Step 1 - Score Objectives: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory points indicated on the card.\n    \n• Step 2 - Reveal Public Objective: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.\n\n• The speaker cannot reveal \"Stage II\" objectives until all \"Stage I\" objectives are revealed.\n        \n• The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.\n\n• Step 3 - Draw Action Cards: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.\n    \n• Step 4 - Remove Command Tokens: Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board. Each player returns each removed token to their reinforcements.\n    \n• Step 5 - Gain and Redistribute Command Tokens: Each player gains two command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements. Then, each player can redistribute each command token on their command sheet, including the two they just gained, among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.\n\n• Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.\n        \n• This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.\n\n• Step 6 - Ready Cards: Each player readies all of their exhausted cards, including strategy cards.\n    \n• Step 7 - Repair Units: Each player repairs all of their damaged units by turning those units upright.\n    \n• Step 8 - Return Strategy Cards: Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.\n\n• A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control each planet in their home system.\n    \n• If there are few cards remaining in the action card deck, they will be dealt out first to the players lowest in initiative order.

Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.\n\n• A technology card's prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.\n\n#\n\n• If a player is instructed to research a technology by any game effect, that player must meet the prerequisites for the technology they research.\n    \n• If a player is instructed to gain a technology, that player does not have to meet the prerequisites, although most game effects that do this will specify what technologies may be gained by that effect.\n    \n• If a player is playing a faction with a faction-specific unit upgrade, they cannot research the generic upgrade for that unit type.\n    \n• For notes about specific generic technologies, see the technology notes page.\n    \n• For notes about specific generic unit upgrades, see the unit notes page.\n    \n• For notes about a technologies of a specific faction, see that faction's notes page.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":90,"keywords":["technology","player","unit","card","any","faction","not","research","technologies","notes"],"crossReferences":["Abilities","Component Action","Exhausted","Readied","Technology (S.C.)","Unit Upgrades"],"difficulty":"advanced"},"embedding":[-0.055,0.064,0.008,-0.087,0.063,-0.002,0.086,-0.016,0.01,0.008,-0.017,-0.03,0.102,0.013,0.021,0.032,0.011,-0.048,-0.062,-0.027,0.056,-0.099,0.048,-0.081,-0.072,0.001,0.008,-0.06,-0.059,0.001,-0.063,0.151,0.052,0.031,-0.013,-0.031,0.03,0.056,0.013,0.042,-0.07,-0.024,0.056,0.047,0.015,0.007,-0.028,-0.08,-0.101,-0.024,-0.087,-0.027,-0.073,0.039,0.04,0.041,0.045,-0.027,0.001,-0.024,0.019,-0.072,-0.051,-0.03,0.047,0.018,0.012,-0.007,-0.037,0.004,0.005,-0.009,-0.036,-0.032,0.031,0.093,0.08,0.078,0.044,-0.144,-0.014,0.083,0.02,-0.049,0.02,-0.006,-0.057,-0.045,0.057,0.029,-0.02,-0.072,0.021,0.004,0.092,0.04,0.014,-0.134,0.019,0.043,0.034,-0.022,-0.003,0.036,-0.056,-0.025,-0.007,0.096,0.044,0.003,0.019,0.015,-0.052,-0.066,-0.073,0.046,0.008,0.017,0.01,0.017,0.041,-0.065,0.039,-0.003,-0.009,-0.043,-0.08,0,0.018,0.025,-0.021,0.046,-0.004,-0.011,-0.019,-0.049,-0.028,0.017,-0.066,0.149,-0.074,0.106,0.123,-0.016,-0.07,0.035,0.063,0.012,0.052,0.063,0.018,-0.029,0.056,0.023,-0.041,-0.02,-0.062,0.017,-0.006,-0.034,0.026,-0.043,0.034,0.023,-0.014,-0.078,0.072,0.016,-0.057,0.003,-0.02,-0.008,0.02,-0.091,0.024,-0.021,-0.035,0.042,-0.042,0.04,0.028,-0.19,0.015,-0.023,0.037,0.064,0.01,0.044,-0.029,-0.021,-0.014,0.068,-0.042,0.09,-0.009,-0.087,0.075,-0.007,-0.053,0.002,0.005,0.003,0.017,0.018,-0.059,0.025,-0.068,0.001,-0.096,0.001,-0.068,-0.013,-0.106,-0.034,0.068,-0.047,-0.029,-0.062,0.009,-0.018,-0.057,0.047,0.09,0,-0.05,-0.053,-0.018,-0.047,0.062,-0.081,0.043,-0.079,-0.006,-0.04,0.032,0.052,-0.105,-0.025,-0.117,-0.028,-0.038,0.017,-0.005,0.062,0.007,0.089,-0.053,0.014,-0.02,0.098,-0.082,0.027,0.029,-0.005,0.037,-0.066,-0.067,0.003,0.017,-0.017,0.045,-0.019,-0.076,0.046,0.064,0,-0.002,0.035,-0.033,-0.046,0.037,-0.048,0.019,-0.054,0.079,-0.012,0.054,-0.046,-0.045,0.046,0.081,0.029,0.012,0.029,0.095,0.025,-0.01,0.033,-0.014,-0.008,0.004,0.062,0.031,-0.022,-0.076,0.016,-0.002,-0.066,0.027,0.027,-0.023,0.019,-0.025,-0.065,-0.103,-0.042,0.015,-0.01,-0.005,0.03,0.002,-0.002,0.017,-0.144,-0.015,-0.04,-0.023,0.031,-0.088,0,-0.028,-0.009,0.028,0.021,0.022,-0.036,0.018,-0.043,-0.043,0.002,0.007,0.053,-0.012,0.012,0.098,0.064,-0.035,-0.054,-0.07,0.008,0,-0.032,-0.006,0.012,-0.033,0.005,-0.007,-0.011,0.093,0.121,0.096,-0.037,0.013,0.001,0.099,0.001,0.043,-0.028,0.016,0.084,-0.031,-0.041,-0.045,0.073,0.068,-0.02,-0.095,-0.062,-0.059,0.048,0.005,-0.019,-0.104,-0.014,-0.042,0.02,0.092,0.069,0.017,-0.031,0.06,0.025,0.08,0.006]},{"id":"rule_technology_sc_main","type":"rule","category":"cards","title":"Technology (Strategy Card)","section":"rules_reference","content":"The Technology strategy card allows players to research new technology.

Those players use the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token.\n\n• The chosen players must resolve the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token after the active player finishes resolving the primary ability.\n        \n• The chosen players can only use the secondary ability once, and they cannot use it by spending command tokens.\n\n• After the active player resolves the primary ability of the Trade strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to replenish their commodities.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":92,"keywords":["player","card","active","trade","ability","strategy","players","commodities","primary","commodity"],"crossReferences":["Command Tokens","Commodities","Initiative Order","Strategic Action","Strategy Card","Trade Goods"],"difficulty":"intermediate"},"embedding":[-0.072,0.036,-0.067,-0.014,0.005,0.051,0.08,0.051,-0.009,0.03,-0.001,-0.044,0.051,0.008,0.025,0.053,-0.033,0.087,-0.103,-0.009,0.087,-0.059,-0.045,-0.047,-0.045,-0.004,-0.011,-0.058,-0.054,-0.067,-0.003,0.116,0.077,0.04,-0.067,0.071,-0.049,0.01,0.04,-0.057,0.03,0.009,-0.023,-0.068,0.01,-0.027,0.002,0.028,-0.034,-0.012,-0.078,0.004,-0.087,0.062,0.004,0.026,-0.045,-0.078,0.045,-0.021,0.01,-0.079,-0.043,-0.031,0.031,-0.056,0.037,-0.024,-0.112,0.008,0.01,-0.02,-0.101,-0.076,0.073,0.028,0.047,0.011,0.039,-0.117,-0.004,0.106,0.017,-0.041,-0.008,-0.047,-0.024,-0.028,0.151,0.044,0,-0.031,0.081,0.03,0.047,0.024,0.034,-0.03,0.034,0.084,0.045,-0.018,0.002,-0.04,-0.013,-0.022,0.002,0.025,-0.02,0.04,-0.078,0.015,-0.064,-0.02,-0.065,0.14,0.008,0.018,-0.007,0.002,0.059,-0.053,0.047,0.011,-0.072,0.015,0.003,0,-0.074,-0.046,-0.025,0.025,-0.041,0.013,0.016,-0.037,-0.064,-0.037,-0.054,0.132,0.005,0.124,0.005,-0.086,-0.013,0.024,0.141,-0.021,0.066,0.085,-0.003,-0.016,0.033,0.051,0.019,-0.069,-0.016,0.048,0.059,-0.063,-0.021,0.044,-0.013,0.101,0.008,0.007,-0.009,-0.073,-0.082,0.001,-0.025,0.036,-0.052,-0.073,0.018,0.056,-0.005,0.076,-0.014,0.027,0.028,-0.146,0.004,-0.08,-0.052,0.049,-0.045,0.01,-0.002,-0.019,0.027,0.089,0.001,0.147,-0.058,-0.094,0.068,-0.052,-0.015,0.078,0.067,0.049,-0.037,-0.003,0.056,0.06,-0.017,-0.014,-0.14,-0.037,-0.072,0.088,-0.106,-0.034,0.035,-0.079,-0.003,-0.059,-0.031,0.023,-0.014,0.084,0.109,0,0.037,-0.011,0.013,0.018,-0.003,-0.035,0.026,-0.025,-0.014,-0.05,-0.084,0.009,-0.021,-0.005,0.025,-0.048,-0.053,0.083,-0.025,0.033,-0.006,0.082,-0.09,0.074,0.009,0.049,-0.048,-0.023,0.015,0.015,0.082,-0.096,-0.058,-0.037,-0.01,0.018,-0.041,0.047,-0.039,0.094,0.052,-0.034,0.017,0.069,-0.024,-0.014,0.12,-0.045,-0.003,-0.023,0.086,-0.007,-0.046,-0.068,-0.036,0.061,0.082,-0.01,0.003,-0.059,0.074,0.046,0.051,0.023,0.045,0.004,-0.019,-0.031,0.036,0.006,0.019,0.041,0.023,-0.049,0.126,0.001,-0.06,-0.036,-0.026,-0.029,-0.071,-0.024,0.024,0.016,-0.037,0,0.033,0.052,0.049,0.012,-0.042,-0.024,-0.015,0.019,-0.071,0,-0.074,-0.02,-0.023,0.087,0.002,0.003,-0.045,-0.063,-0.043,0.026,0.03,0.049,-0.061,-0.078,0.026,-0.017,0.021,-0.021,-0.094,-0.044,0.005,-0.029,-0.002,-0.038,0.014,-0.036,-0.02,0.016,0.043,0.055,0.045,0.025,-0.024,0.015,-0.018,0.032,-0.008,-0.022,-0.013,0.03,-0.033,-0.004,-0.053,0.03,0.008,0.012,-0.102,-0.038,0.03,-0.01,-0.065,-0.025,-0.035,0.049,0,0.016,0.004,0.048,0.052,-0.052,0.034,0.017,-0.05,-0.015]},{"id":"rule_trade_notes","type":"rule","category":"cards","title":"Trade (Strategy Card) - Notes","section":"notes","content":"• Say, for example, Alice is the active player, and is performing a strategic action with the Trade strategy card.

However, they will still trigger any \"when [this] player replenishes commodities\" effects, most notably the Trade Agreement promissory note.","metadata":{"ruleNumber":92,"keywords":["player","commodities","ability","trade","card","secondary","active","replenish","strategy","players"],"crossReferences":["Command Tokens","Commodities","Initiative Order","Strategic Action","Strategy Card","Trade Goods"],"difficulty":"intermediate"},"embedding":[-0.061,0.03,-0.035,-0.004,-0.012,0.054,0.089,0.046,0.042,0.047,0.015,-0.019,0.082,-0.008,0.023,0.075,-0.025,0.079,-0.118,-0.008,0.076,-0.117,-0.042,-0.063,-0.044,-0.026,-0.032,-0.045,-0.034,-0.072,-0.02,0.124,0.049,0.045,-0.113,0.072,-0.021,-0.019,0.04,-0.05,0.019,0.032,-0.005,-0.073,0.009,-0.023,-0.003,-0.007,-0.064,-0.042,-0.038,0.015,-0.086,0.095,-0.001,0.024,-0.021,-0.071,0.005,-0.019,-0.007,-0.041,-0.072,-0.055,0.051,-0.064,0.043,-0.028,-0.106,0.013,0.018,-0.038,-0.099,-0.086,0.078,0.002,0.061,0.01,0.01,-0.087,-0.03,0.121,0.006,-0.051,-0.021,-0.07,-0.055,-0.057,0.147,0.037,0.001,-0.02,0.052,0.045,0.071,0.014,0.081,-0.013,0.023,0.076,0.024,0.001,0.019,-0.059,0.017,-0.028,-0.017,-0.014,-0.031,0.013,-0.067,-0.035,-0.044,-0.009,-0.056,0.133,0.021,-0.003,0.004,-0.042,0.053,-0.056,0.066,0.019,-0.056,-0.016,0.037,0,-0.06,-0.034,-0.013,-0.02,-0.006,0.002,0.026,-0.025,-0.048,-0.046,-0.05,0.123,-0.013,0.117,0.015,-0.06,0.002,0.032,0.129,-0.027,0.106,0.094,0.005,-0.006,0.021,0.033,0.026,-0.029,-0.05,0.035,0.063,-0.049,-0.004,0.037,-0.027,0.071,0.011,0.022,0.002,-0.041,-0.044,-0.004,-0.005,0.011,-0.043,-0.07,0.024,0.051,0.021,0.074,-0.009,0.018,0.041,-0.131,0.007,-0.046,-0.044,0.041,-0.045,0.043,-0.002,-0.029,0.012,0.093,-0.033,0.112,-0.042,-0.102,0.087,-0.059,-0.057,0.041,0.079,0.007,0.021,-0.021,0.034,0.031,-0.013,-0.009,-0.14,-0.026,-0.063,0.105,-0.094,-0.033,0.043,-0.061,-0.012,-0.051,-0.009,0.031,0.005,0.075,0.132,0,0.033,-0.024,0.006,0.016,0.039,-0.035,0.034,-0.049,-0.043,-0.082,-0.1,0.011,-0.007,0,0.039,-0.02,-0.056,0.048,-0.036,0.054,0.015,0.067,-0.063,0.011,0.021,0.048,-0.047,0.022,0.018,0.049,0.06,-0.104,-0.084,-0.023,-0.014,-0.004,-0.063,0.076,-0.044,0.1,0.046,-0.047,0.03,0.073,0.016,-0.013,0.105,-0.059,0.029,-0.051,0.107,0.017,-0.079,-0.036,-0.025,0.066,0.081,-0.006,0.032,-0.091,0.031,0.035,0.061,0.014,0.06,0.02,-0.007,-0.06,0.018,0,0.011,0.03,0.051,-0.065,0.126,0.016,-0.068,-0.017,-0.024,-0.022,-0.105,-0.02,0.02,0.01,-0.068,0.003,0.012,0.016,0.046,-0.01,0.006,0.011,-0.012,0.005,-0.046,0,-0.066,-0.047,-0.012,0.068,0.03,0.005,-0.04,-0.034,-0.043,0.061,0.035,0.073,-0.016,-0.067,0.022,-0.009,0.056,-0.04,-0.107,-0.03,-0.031,-0.034,-0.012,-0.038,-0.003,-0.034,-0.009,0.003,0.036,0.076,0.071,0.021,-0.019,0.027,0,0.021,0.026,-0.024,-0.04,0.031,0,-0.02,-0.026,0.029,0.044,0.002,-0.095,-0.064,0.032,0.008,-0.033,-0.045,-0.044,0.004,-0.007,0.019,-0.006,0.028,0.023,-0.034,0.03,0.022,-0.006,-0.012]},{"id":"rule_trade_goods_main","type":"rule","category":"resources","title":"Trade Goods","section":"rules_reference","content":"A trade good represents a player's buying and trading power beyond their planet's raw resources.\n\n• Trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token.\n    \n• When a player gains a trade good, they take a trade good token from the supply and place it on the trade good area on their command sheet, making sure the trade good side is faceup.\n    \n• A player can spend trade goods at any time during the game.\n    \n• A player can spend a trade good in one of the following ways:\n\n• In place of spending one resource.\n        \n• In place of spending one influence.

Points","section":"rules_reference","content":"The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.\n\n• Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.\n    \n• Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.\n\n• If the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.\n\n• Each player places one of their control tokens on space \"0\" of the victory point track during setup.\n    \n• When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.\n\n• A player's control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game.
